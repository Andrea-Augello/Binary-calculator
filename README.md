## Raspberry Pi model 4B

The target for this project is a general-purpose Single-Board Computer: the Raspberry Pi 4B [Fig. \ref{pi4}], it is the latest iteration of the Raspberry Pi SoC, launched on 24th June 2019[@PI_release],
it replaces the older Raspberry Pi 3 B+ which was based on the Broadcom BCM2835 chip[@BCM2835][@BCM2835_datasheet_errata] and boasts high-end specs:

* A 1.5GHz quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72 CPU
* 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB of LPDDR4 SDRAM
* Full-throughput Gigabit Ethernet
* Dual-band 802.11ac wireless networking
* Bluetooth 5.0
* Two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 ports
* Dual monitor support, at resolutions up to 4K
* VideoCore VI graphics, supporting OpenGL ES 3.x
* 4Kp60 hardware decode of HEVC video
* Complete compatibility with earlier Raspberry Pi products

Although claiming complete backward compatibility with earlier products, the documentation available[@pi4_datasheet] is not very comprehensive, which makes porting code not always straightforward.

## FTDI FT232RL
The FT232RL is a USB to serial UART interface[@FT232RL].
Without this peripheral, it is not possible to send data to and from the  Board with ease: modern computers do not expose serial ports that can be connected to the GPIOs.  
This module is needed to provide a virtual communication port for the computer to send data over to the Pi.
The FTDI module is connected to a computer through its USB port, and to the Raspberry Pi 4 UART1 by the following configuration:


* FTDI-RX to RPi-GPIO14 (TX)
* FTDI-TX to RPi-GPIO15 (RX)
* FTDI-Ground to RPi-GND

## I/O choices
### Qteatak push buttons

![\label{buttons}](https://www.ubuy.co.th/productimg/?image=aHR0cHM6Ly9tLm1lZGlhLWFtYXpvbi5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL0kvNTE2bnRENnE4M0wuX0FDX1VTMjE4Xy5qcGc.jpg)

With ease of use and familiarity of a potential end-user with similar products in mind, push buttons were considered an appropriate choice for the input method,
moreover, single buttons were chosen in favor of a button matrix because a 3x3 button matrix would require 6 pin connections against the 7 needed in the other case, but the added complexity does not make it a worthwhile trade-off.  

The chosen buttons are 6x6x5 mm tactile push buttons with two pins[Fig. \ref{buttons}] produced by Qteatak, a Shenzhen based electronics company.  
These buttons are rated to work with up to 12V of direct current, so they are safe for use with the 3,3V output of the GPIO pins of the Raspberry.

Their mechanical life expectancy is of 100000 uses which leads to a worst-case scenario of 6250 operations before a malfunction, considering the intended purpose of this project, such a life expectancy is deemed sufficient.  

### LED

![\label{led}](./media/led.jpeg)

Due to the choice of base two for the calculator, a straightforward approach to display values is through the use of LED lights, with lit LEDs representing a 1 bit and an off light representing a 0 bit.    

To avoid possible confusion when interpreting the result, an extra LED lights up to signal if the shown number is negative and, as such, has to be read as a two's complement.  
Moreover, since there is a very limited number of bits to display values if the actual result of an operation lies outside the representable range and is thus truncated, an extra LED light will turn on to signal the overflow.

# Environment

## pijFORTHos

FORTH interpreters can be implemented easily for resource-constrained machines using no OS, so they are well-suited for bare-metal interactive development.

 The pijFORTHos environment is based on an assembly FORTH interpreter called JonesForth[@JonesForth], originally written for i686 assembly by _Richard WM Jones_.

 Due to its simplicity, JonesForth has been adapted to many different architectures, some of those portings brought to the Bare-Metal OS for the Raspberry Pi.

## Ubuntu 19.04

## Picocom and Minicom
Minicom is a terminal emulator software for Unix-like operating systems. It is commonly used when setting up a remote serial console.[@Minicom]  
Picocom is, in principle, very similar to minicom.
It was designed as a simple, manual, modem configuration, testing, and debugging tool.[@Picocom]  


In effect, picocom is not an "emulator" per se. It is a simple program that opens, configures, manages a serial port (tty device) and its settings, and connects to it the terminal emulator already in use.

In the scope of this project, it is used as a serial communications program to allow access to the serial console of the Raspberry.

As ASCII-XFR[@ASCII] was chosen to send the source file to the Raspberry, it  

[...]

Trough the command
`picocom --b 115200 /dev/tyyUSB0 --imap delbs -s "ascii-xfr -sv -l100 -c10"
` picocom is launched on the development machine with the same VCP parameters as the Pi UART:

* `--b 115200`: 115200 bit/s bit rate.
* `--imap delbs`: allows the use of backspace to delete a character.
* `-s "ascii-xfr -sv -l100 -c10"`: specifies ascii-xfr as the external command to use for transmitting files.
    * `-sv`: verbose send mode.
    * `-l100`: sets a 100 milliseconds delay after each line is sent, this usually gives enough time to run a command and be ready for the next line in time.
    * `-c10`: waits 8 milliseconds between each character sent.

# Software
Since it is not possible with the selected environment to have the Raspberry automatically load the source code at startup, the code is to be sent via a serial connection.

The file transfer happens character by character at a quite limited speed, with significant delay after every character and newline, furthermore, every file has to be selected singularly.  
To cut down on transfer times, it is convenient to use a bash script to exclude unessential parts of the code (i.e. comments and empty lines), remove unnecessary newlines, and merge everything into a single file.

The developed script, `merge_source.sh`, makes use of `awk`[@awk] to recognize comments and not print them, and remove newlines,
 `sed`[@sed] adds a newline after each ';' so that after each word is compiled, there will be a 100 ms delay.  
A back-of-the-envelope estimate shows a reduction of the loading time of 76.9 seconds.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cd src
cat se-ans.f utils.f logic.f output.f input.f control.f |
awk -F"\\" '{print $1}' |                          # Removes '\' comments
awk -F"[^A-Z]+[()][^A-Z]+" '{print $1 $    3}' |   # Removes '( )' comments
awk '{ printf "%s ", $0 }' |                       # Removes newlines
sed 's/\;/\;\n/g' |                                # Adds a newline after ;
sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' > ../merged_src.f   
```

## ANSI compliance
JonesForth is not ANSI compliant[@pijFORTHos], hence some standard words do not behave as one would expect.

The `se-ans.f` code provided in the course materials contains some definitions to ensure compliance for some words of common use.

This code is the first to be loaded to ensure that the subsequent instructions are executed correctly.

## Utilities

This section of code provides some hardware abstraction. The code begins with peripherals registers definitions, followed by some short words used to make the code more readable.  
Another utility function defined in this file is `DELAY`, which implements with a busy loop a wait for the time passed as argument (in microseconds).  

The other FORTH words in this file deal with low-level GPIO functionalities: function selection and setting the pull for the input pins.  
The Raspberry Pi 4 B has a different procedure to set the internal pull-up/down compared to the older models, hence two functions are provided for compatibility's sake.
The available documentation[@pi4_datasheet] does not show this change yet, however,
by analyzing how some C libraries added support for the Broadcom 2711 GPIO[@pingpio] [@raspi-gpio], one can gain insight on how to change the pull-up/down settings.


## Inner representation

## Input

All the operations related to the input are in a single file, the aim is to achieve low coupling between components of the project, and allow future alterations with as little restructuring as possible.

The numbers of the pins linked to digit keys and those connected to operation keys are stored in two different arrays.  
This is because, although the operations on these are strikingly similar, they hardly ever occur on both sets of pins at the same time: it only happens when dealing with GPIO registers.  
In those occurrences it is only necessary to use a mask, which can be computed once in advance, consequently having them in a single array offers no added benefit.    

At the beginning of the code masks for both sets of pins are computed and, since they will not be changing at runtime, stored as literals.  
These masks are used to only act on bits related to pins in use for this project.

 Two separate words implement procedures to read which keys have been pressed and to clear the event detection status. This is because the capability to pause until a key is pressed, without wiping the register, can be beneficial in many occurrences.

A different word has the task to determine whether the registered keypress is a digit or an operation. Subsequent procedures will resolve, from the value of the event detection register, the specific button which prompted the status change.

### Debouncing

While testing the input code, a single button press sometimes would, due to a phenomenon known as bouncing[@ganssle2004guide], generate multiple falling edges.

Although there are some widely available valid hardware solutions[@gay2017mc14490], the nature of this application does not warrant the added hardware complexity: the responsiveness requirements are quite lax, so it is possible to use some CPU cycles to solve the bouncing issues in software.


Trial and error showed that undesired falling edges could happen in two circumstances: while pressing the button and after release.  
The first issue was trivial to fix: after detecting a button release, a check on the GPLEV0 register, after a short delay, can easily confirm whether the button release truly happened or the circuit is still closed.

```forth
: PEEK_KEYPRESS    
   [ OP_MASK DIGIT_MASK OR ] LITERAL
   GPEDS0 @ AND
   DUP 0 <>
   IF  
      1 MILLISECONDS DELAY
      GPLEV0 @ INVERT AND        
   THEN ;                       
```

To prevent the second case of incorrect triggering, the former approach will not yield satisfying results: in both genuine and spurious falling edges, the level after they are registered is low.  
It is not either a reasonable solution to check the level a short interval of time before each read of the event detection status:
this approach would be equivalent to constantly polling the pin level at a fixed sampling rate and waiting for a change, which defeats the purpose of setting up an event detection.

After extensive testing[^Bounce_test], it was found that the second falling edge happened, on average, after $170.3 \mu s$ $(\sigma = 113.97)$ from the first one,
 so, assuming Gaussian distribution, 99% of the bouncing events will be within $435\mu s$,[Fig. \ref{Bouncing_distribution}] which implies that adding a delay of 1ms before clearing the event detect register guarantees avoiding reading a bounce as an actual key press.


 ![Bouncing distribution\label{Bouncing_distribution}](./media/Bouncing_distribution.png)

[^Bounce_test]: The time intercurring between falling edges was computed by polling the event detection register in a loop and storing a timestamp.
  To achieve more accurate readings, all output operations were executed after the measurements were completed.

According to the data from [@kinkead1975typing] and [@wiklund1987optimizing], the expected typing speed of a user is such that these added delays would not introduce noticeable unresponsiveness.

## Output

With the same objective of achieving low coupling the file `output.f` contains all the words related to the output functions.  

Since there is no direct relationship between how many bits the display can show and the actual size of the numbers (although it would be a natural choice to have them coincide), the code begins declaring the size of the display, followed by the GPIO pins used to control the output.  

The chosen method to display values is a set of 8 LED lights, so the actual implementation here is quite straightforward: given a value to show, a mask is computed[^mask] and written into GPSET0.   
Additionally,  a second value passed to the `SHOW` function dictates whether to turn on or off the status LED.  
Of course, since the procedure previously described is only concerned with turning on LEDs, the first operation to show correct values is to clear the display; to do so a mask for every display pin is written into GPCLR0.

[^mask]: The n-th bit of the number multiplies the mask for the n-th pin, and a logic `OR` is performed amongst those values.
